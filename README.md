# cmdline-fib-iterator
I wanted to practice uploading on github so I made this..

This repository contains only one file that lets users calculate the nth Fibonacci number from the command line.

I thought it would be fun to implement iterator protocol for the Fibonacci program. The program uses the iterative solution so its time complexity is linear. 

I am uploading this for personal/educational reasons. Thanks.
